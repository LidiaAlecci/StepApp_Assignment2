# StepApp_Assignment2

This is a student project required for the course of "Mobile and Wearable Computing" at the second year of the master degree in Computer Science at Universit√† della Svizzera Italiana (Lugano).

## Request

This is an improvement of the previous app (StepApp_Assignment1) so now it's request to create a bar chart that shows the number of steps by date.

It was developed in October 2020.
